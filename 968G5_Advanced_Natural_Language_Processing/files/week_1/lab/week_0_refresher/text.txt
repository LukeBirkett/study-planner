Water bills will rise by £2.70 a month on average from April, a year on from hefty increases for households in many parts of the country.

The average annual bill in England and Wales will increase by £33 to £639, prompting calls for a "stronger safety net" for those unable to pay.

The size of the increase and the cost of the average bill both vary widely across different regions, with one water-only supplier raising prices by 13%.

The industry trade body, Water UK, said bill increases were needed to fund vital upgrades to the system and tackle spillages that have caused a public outcry.

The figures come a few days after it was announced water bills in Scotland would rise by an average of £42 a year (up 8.7%), taking the average bill to £532 a year.
