# Advanced Natural Language Proccessing Notes (Spring 26)

This is the main file for the Advanced Natural Language Proccessing module taken in Spring 26. It will act as the location for note taking accross all mediums, i.e. lectures, videos, labs and additional readings, as well as a directory for file locations. It will be recorded chronologically with a section for each week.

# [Week 1 - Lexical and Distributional Semantics Revisited](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/35245/pages/week-1-introduction-2?module_item_id=1546317)

This week is for reviewing the core concepts from lexical semantics and distributional semantics. It will essentially be a revision session from the Applied Natural Language Processing module from last year. The topics covered will be:
* Word sense ambiguity
* WordNet
* Lexical semantic relations
* Semantic similarity
* Measuring Information Content
* Vector space representations based on context
* (Positive) Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI)
* Cosine similarity
* Challenges in distributional semantics

#### Week 1: Contents

4. [Additional Readings](#week-1---additional-readings)

## Week 1 - Lecture 

[Lecture Part 1](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c7d2751c-0820-4e87-8b8d-acb400db8436&start=1.23467)

[Lecture Part 2](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=15631590-2d19-4dcd-98bf-acb400db95f6&start=0)

**TODO:** Watch and Notes


## Week 1 - Lab

Lab exercises are based on the previous weeks lecture and seminar content.  Week 1 falls before any seminar hence is a self-assessment excercise to work out our starting level using prior knowledge.

## Week 1 - Seminar 

The paper to read for this seminar is [Information Content Measures of Semantic Similarity Perform Better Without Sense Tagged Text (2010) by Ted Pedersen](files/week_1/week_1_seminar_paper.pdf). 

**TODO:** Reading Paper and take some notes


[Seminar Questions](files/week_1/week_1_seminar_questions.pdf) **TODO:** break out into this file
