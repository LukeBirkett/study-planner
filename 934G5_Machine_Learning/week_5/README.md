# [Week 5 - Model Validation I](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31315)
This week, we will look at collection and preprocessing of data for machine learning. 

### Learning outcomes:
By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will have learnt about:
- things to consider before, for, and in collection of machine learning data; 
- typical issues that need to be addressed in preparing input data and labels for machine learning.
