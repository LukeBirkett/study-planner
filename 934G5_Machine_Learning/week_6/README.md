# [Week 6 - Model Validation II](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31315/pages/week-6-model-validation-ii?module_item_id=1445749)
This week, we will look at data dimensionality reduction for input data as well as model evaluation strategies and metrics. 

### Learning outcomes:
By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will have learnt about:

- principal component analysis and its use in dimensionality reduction; 
- evaluation methods and metrics.
