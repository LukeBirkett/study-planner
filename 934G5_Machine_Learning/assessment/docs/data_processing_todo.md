# Data Processing TODO List - ML Coursework 2025A3

## Overview
This document contains additional considerations for the data processing pipeline that were identified as potentially missing from the main data processing notes. Use this list to determine what falls within the scope of your project and what can be addressed later.

## Priority 1: Core Functionality (Essential for Project Success)

### Aggregation Strategy Details - COMPLETED
- [x] **Aggregation Function Decisions**
  - Define rules for each parameter (sum vs. average vs. max/min)
  - Document reasoning for each choice
  - Consider parameter-specific requirements
- [x] **Missing Data Handling in Aggregation**
  - Strategy for 3-hourly gaps when creating daily values
  - Minimum data threshold for valid daily aggregation
  - Interpolation vs. forward-fill vs. backward-fill decisions
- [x] **Edge Case Handling**
  - Dataset start/end date considerations
  - Leap year handling (February 29th, 2024)
  - Data continuity across month boundaries

## Priority 2: Important for Robustness (Should Include if Time Permits)

### Geographic Coverage & Resolution

  - Document exact longitude/latitude grid coverage
  - Identify any missing or irregular grid points
  - Plan for handling incomplete geographic coverage
- [ ] **Boundary Conditions**
  - Consider edge cases at grid boundaries
  - Handle coastal vs. inland location differences
  - Plan for international date line crossing

### Memory & Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Chunk Size Optimization**
  - Determine optimal batch sizes for processing
  - Test memory usage with different chunk sizes
  - Balance memory efficiency vs. processing speed
- [ ] **Data Type Optimization**
  - Use appropriate data types (float32 vs float64)
  - Consider integer encoding for categorical variables
  - Optimize memory usage without losing precision
- [ ] **Parallel Processing Opportunities**
  - Identify tasks that can run concurrently
  - Plan for multi-core utilization
  - Consider distributed processing for very large datasets

### Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] **Processing Error Handling**
  - Strategy for corrupted files
  - Unexpected data format responses
  - Graceful degradation when possible
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**
  - Monitor long-running processing jobs
  - Estimate completion times
  - Provide user feedback during processing
- [ ] **Data Lineage Tracking**
  - Document which raw files contributed to outputs
  - Track processing steps applied
  - Enable reproducibility and debugging

## Priority 3: Nice to Have (Include if Significant Time Available)

### Validation & Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - Test individual processing functions
  - Validate edge cases and error conditions
  - Ensure consistent behavior across different inputs
- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - Test end-to-end data pipeline
  - Validate data flow between processing steps
  - Test with sample datasets
- [ ] **Data Quality Tests**
  - Automated checks for processed data quality
  - Statistical validation of aggregated results
  - Cross-reference with known weather patterns

### Documentation & Reproducibility
- [ ] **Processing Logs**
  - Detailed logs of all transformations applied
  - Parameter values used in processing
  - Timestamps and execution times
- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - Parameterize processing options
  - Version control for processing logic
  - Environment dependency tracking
- [ ] **Reproducible Environment**
  - Document exact software versions
  - Create requirements.txt or environment.yml
  - Consider containerization (Docker)


## Implementation Notes

### Scope Decision Framework
- **Must Have**: Priority 1 items essential for basic functionality
- **Should Have**: Priority 2 items that significantly improve robustness
- **Could Have**: Priority 3 items that add polish and maintainability
- **Won't Have**: Priority 4 items beyond current project scope

### Progress Summary
- **Completed**: 60% of original TODO items
- **Remaining**: 40% of items (mostly optimization and robustness)
- **Next Focus**: Geographic Coverage & Resolution (Priority 2)

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: ✅ RESOLVED - Aggregation strategy now fully defined
- **Medium Risk**: Poor error handling could cause pipeline failures
- **Low Risk**: Missing documentation affects maintainability but not functionality

## Next Steps
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Data validation and quality assurance planning
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Data processing strategy and implementation approach
3. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Aggregation Strategy Details (Priority 1)
4. **NEXT**: Focus on Priority 2 - Geographic Coverage & Resolution
5. **THEN**: Implement remaining Priority 2 items for robustness
6. **FINALLY**: Add Priority 3 items for polish and maintainability
