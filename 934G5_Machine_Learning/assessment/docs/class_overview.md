# Module title: Machine Learning

This module will equip students with knowledge and practical experience for building and evaluating machine learning models. The module will cover multiple learning categories including supervised learning, and a variety of algorithms will be covered (both traditional approaches and those that are state of the art, e.g. advanced neural networks). The module will involve exploring the maths behind each algorithm as well as hands-on work (with software libraries) on real data.

# Module Goals:
- Demonstrate comprehensive understanding of key aspects of machine learning and standard methods;
- Show awareness of relevant issues and current challenges in machine learning;
- Systematically and creatively build and evaluate machine learning models;
- Act autonomously in preparing data appropriately to address a given problem, selecting the most suitable techniques to address the problem, and communicating valid rationale for choices made.

# Employability Skills:
- Potential employers would usually want applicants to demonstrate, e.g. in technical interviews, theoretical and applied/practical knowledge that will be taught in the lectures. 
- Being able to apply these knowledge to unfamiliar machine learning problems would usually be necessary to show potential employers, e.g. an applicant may be given a mini-project to solve as part of their application process, that you have true understanding. You will be given opportunity to develop this skill with lab materials as well as with the coursework.
- As machine learning is a constantly growing field with new methods (and concerns) continuously emerging, a useful attitude to be able to demonstrate to potential employers is (self-motivated) curiosity, reflective & critical thinking, and problem solving. Throughout the module, you will have the opportunity to practice these by going beyond material provided by the teacher: 
    - looking 'behind the scenes' of existing software libraries, by reading documentation and source code for software library functions used in lab tasks;
    - digging further into relevant maths/theory, by exploring suggested readings (textbooks, research publications);
    - asking (research) questions and investigating them (with critical analysis of methods and experiment results), following on from given lab tasks.
These could lead to tangible outcomes, e.g. personal GitHub projects, that could be highlighted in a CV (and cover letter, where appropriate). 

- Some of the materials in the lecture will highlight current affairs beyond technical knowledge (theoretical/applied), e.g. public debate on ethical issues, machine-learning-based technology available for public/corporate/etc use. These will hopefully lead the student to themselves keep up  with (public) trends in the field that could be used to demonstrate commercial awareness to potential employers, e.g., in a cover letter.
