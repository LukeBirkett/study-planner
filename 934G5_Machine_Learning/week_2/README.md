# [Week 2 - Supervised Learning 1](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31315/pages/week-2-supervised-learning-i?module_item_id=1445745)
This week, we will have a look at supervised learning algorithms not based on the basic linear model. 

### Learning outcomes
- By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will have:
- learnt the basic theory behind decision tree, ensemble learning algorithms, and k-nearest neighbours.
explored these algorithms in practice.
