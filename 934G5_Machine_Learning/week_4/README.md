# [Week 4 - Supervised Learning 3](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31315/pages/week-4-supervised-learning-iii?module_item_id=1445747)
This week, we will start to look at neural networks, which is a category of machine learning algorithms that can be used for supervised learning. 

### Learning outcomes:
By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will know the fundamentals of:
- the perceptron & the multilayer perceptron (MLP); 
- fully-connected feedforward and backpropagation.
