# [Week 10 - Attention](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31315/pages/week-10-attention?module_item_id=1445753)
This week, we will have a look at attention in the context of neural networks.  There will also be a guest lecture from Prof Daniel RoggenLinks to an external site. (Research Scientist at Google) who will share about his experience developing wearable technologies and AI in both academia and industry.

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will know the fundamentals of transformers, which is the state of art in attention mechanisms. You will also have some insight into work as an AI scientist/engineer.
