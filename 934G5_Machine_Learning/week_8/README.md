# [Week 8 - Advanced Neural Networks](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31315/pages/week-8-advanced-neural-networks?module_item_id=1445751)
This week, we will look at two special kinds of neural networks, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. 

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will know the fundamentals of:
- convolutional neural networks (CNN); 
- long short-term neural networks (LSTMNN), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN).
