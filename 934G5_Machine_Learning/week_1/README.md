# [Week 1 - Introduction](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31315/pages/week-1-introduction?module_item_id=1445744)
We are starting off with an introduction to machine learning, with a quick overview of example real-world applications as well as a look at the basic linear model, which is fundamental to machine learning. We will also discuss what you can expect from the module.

Learning outcomes
By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will:
- be familiar with some of the basic terms, concepts, and notations in machine learning; 
- have explored the basic linear model (regression and classification).
