[intro video]

[something about what is a complex system]
properties of complex systems
jet engine, might be complex depending on def
but we dont want a jet enginge to have some components of complex systems
compelx systems cant fully be understand
cant ensure we know the outcome, too complex
we are looking at comlex not complicated per say
jet enginge is complicated but we dont want it to do unknown things
complex systems loose the component of control 
complex sys = very large number of components
brain = example of complex system
neurons = lots of small bits working together
emergence is a key theme in complex systems


dynamics on network means things that happen on the network, i.e. firing
there is also dynamics of the netowrk, i.e. how many neurons there are 
these two things can mix

[module objective]
TODO: copy out slides
not a formal graph theory module, less maths
goal is to abstract real worl scenarios into network science
visual stuff 
centrality and its measures

[Tutorial Workthrough w/ Nodes](981G5_Network_Science/week_1/week_1_netX_tutorial.ipynb)

TODO: Explain parts of tutorial and copy out some of the additional notes. 

You can use NetworkX to construct and draw graphs that are undirected or directed, with weighted or unweighted edges. An array of functions to analyze graphs is available.
