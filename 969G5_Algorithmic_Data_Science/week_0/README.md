# Instructions
During the first lab, and your study time this week, you are encouraged to work on your Python skills and your mathematics, whatever your level of prior experience with these:

1. Python Crash Course: All students are expected to work through the two "Crash Course" notebooks so we begin the module from a common Python baseline. Whether you are new to Python, or need refreshing, these notebooks should be useful for you. For those who would like a bit more of a programming warm-up, there is also an optional set of "programming challenge" questions.
