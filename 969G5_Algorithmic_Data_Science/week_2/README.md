# [Week 2](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31352/modules)
This week we will be thinking about the complexity of an algorithm and how this impacts on run-time. We will consider how run-time grows with the size of a problem, defined in terms of the input data. For example, if we wish to sort a list of 10 numbers, the problem is small and it does not matter much which algorithm we use to solve the problem (it need only be correct). However, if we wish to sort billions of numbers, the need for an efficient algorithm becomes apparent. We will discuss best-case, worst-case and average-case variation (i.e., are there other factors which impact run-time other than size of input, e.g., the order of the input?), and introduce O notation. We apply the theory to sorting algorithms.

#### Learning outcomes
By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will be able to:
- Work out the asymptotic run time of simple algorithms, in O notation.
- Be able to establish the asymptotic run-time function of an algorithm by running experiments in Python.
