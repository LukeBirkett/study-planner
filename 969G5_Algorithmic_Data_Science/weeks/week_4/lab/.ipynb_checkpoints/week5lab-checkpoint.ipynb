    "# Week 5 (Unit 4) lab: Multiprocessing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are exploring the multiprocessing capabilities of Python to support the concepts of Processes, Process Lifecycle and Concurrent Execution. Over the last few weeks we've examined the time complexity of several different algorithms for sorting and matrix multiplication. To interrogate their behaviour, we instantiated the algorithm `N` times and were evaluating these _sequentially_, calculating the mean running time and standard deviation and examining how the dependent variable (time) changes as we linearly increase some independent variable (size of list or matrix). \n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, this approach is going to be quite slow, since it's only leveraging a single available CPU core. For example, running 100 repeats sequentially of a product between two 250x250 square matrixes can take quite a long time. But we might have multiple CPU cores available to us, and we can leverage these by creating multiple worker processes to get results much faster. But we have to be careful, if we do this incorrectly, we will add noise to our results making them much less reliable and/or harder to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's lab provides you with both the tools and the intutition for how to find the critical threshold that maximises use of the resources available to you on any given machine (this approach is scalable beyond a single machine). You are tasked with running a `core_investigation` to find the critical threshold for the machine you are working on (i.e. that doesn't add noise to the running time of an algorithm). You are provided with an arbitrary algorithm, contained in `defs.py` - the function `work_that_CPU` - and we want to minimise the amount of time it takes to run `N` instantiations of the algorithm, while keeping the amount of work within each instantiation fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should empirically demonstrate what the optimal number of processes is and _explain why_. Think about what is going on within the machine. Why would results be unreliable when we've breached the critical threshold?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed this, you are then tasked with splitting up the resources you do have available in a way that will provide you with the best assessment of the performance of the algorithm in question."
