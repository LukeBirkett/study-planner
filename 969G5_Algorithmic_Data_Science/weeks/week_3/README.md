# [Matrices](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/35221/modules#:~:text=Manipulation%20and%20computation-,Lecture,-3%20/%20Lab%204)
This week we will be looking at matrix algebra. We will start with basic matrix theory and consider operations such as transpose, inverse and multiplication, including Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. We will consider what happens when we scale up to big data.

#### Learning outcomes
- Do basic matrix manipulations yourself on small matrices.
- Understand asymptotic run-times of some matrix manipulations.
- Do some basic matrix manipulations in Python and empirically examine their time complexity.
