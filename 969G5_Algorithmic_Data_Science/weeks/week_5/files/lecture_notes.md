# Heap Sorting Algo

Heaps are binary tress which satisfiy the heap property

Value[parent[i] <= value[i]]

Heapify is an algo to turn a binary tree intp a heap

Start at all non-leaf nodes at the bottom (not very lowests, lowest with connections)

Compare and swap with parents and nodes

O(n log n) to build heap
O(n log n) extract sorted list from heap

n for num items to loop through

log n for traversing and swapping 

# GPU and CPU

GPU is for many more but simple, smaller, process

e.g. array/matrix arithmetic

Security is made of three key pieces:
Authentication: identify who each user is
Authorisation: control who is allowed to do what
Enforcement: ensure that users only do what they are allowed to do
