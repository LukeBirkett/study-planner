# [Distributed Computation](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/35221/pages/overview-week-5-2?module_item_id=1567846)
We will briefly consider heaps for process queuing, and compare CPUs and GPUs for parallelism. Then we will take a little look at distributed computation, describing the basic set-up of data centres, and briefly discussing how they achieve synchronisation and how one interacts with them via Remote Procedure Calls. We then discuss the essentials of cybersecurity.

#### Learning outcomes:
- Know the basic set-up of data centres and remote procedure calls.
- Understand the basic principles and uses of hashing and encryption in cybersecurity.
