# Similarity
This week we will look at the fundamental data science problem of finding the similarity of data points.

We will cover a number of similarity and distance measures including Jaccard's measure and cosine measure. We will look at how these might be applied in different applications including document similarity. We will consider different representations including bag-of-words and shingles.

Then we will introduce the technique of minhashing, which reduces the size of representations whilst preserving Jaccard similarity between sets. Finally, we will consider locality sensitive hashing, which enables fast nearest-neighbour search.


#### Learning outcomes:
- Understand and apply the Jaccard and cosine measures of similarity.
- Understand the theory of minhashing as an efficient method for analysing similarity on large datasets.
- Understand locality sensitive hashing.
