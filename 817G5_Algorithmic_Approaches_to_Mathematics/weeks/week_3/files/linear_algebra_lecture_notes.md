# Linear Algebra

the lecture will cover the basics (the bare min)

3B provides a deeper understanding

Cheatsheet gives a little more information

+ the notebooks

complicated objs often boil down to arrays or matrices

data can be moulded into a shape: vector/matrix

this structure can be manipluated and changed

transformed

vectorized 

vector/matrices have a shape

vector = 1d array, 1 index, [n], row or col
matrix = 2d array, 2 indices, [n,m], rows and cols
tensor = 3d array, 3 indiex, [n,m,l], the 3rd dimension is a layer
