position of car as a function of time

velocity of point time in time: this doesnt make sense. velocity requires comprison of positions at two points in time

note: velocity has direction (can be negative), speed is just dist covered

average velocity over a time interval

take velocity over a period and keep making the internval smaller. we take to take the interval as small as we can. that will proxy as our velocity in a point in time

recall distance/position is function of time x(t) = km

interval captured as [t] and [t + change in t]

hence change in dist x(t) and x(t + change t)

we want shink the change in t to an infinitesimally small interval

the math term/symbol for lim is lim

velocity is input is time

velocity (2t) at time t is the stepeness of the tangent

volocity is call the derviative of the position with respect to t

velocity is a differential quantity 

time: t
change in time: tri time
infinit small change in time: dt

dt = differential quanity

velocity is dx(t) / dt

dt is just a really small number/fraction

velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time

aka velocity is the derivative with respect to time

dx = velocity(t) * dt

dx(t) -> this means is depends on t

vel(t) = dx(t) / dt

tip is to read bottom first: dt

it is saying when this thing changes, how much does the top thing change

rate of change of x with respect to y

deriviate is the rate of change

deriv of f(x) = x^3 is f'(x) = 3x^2

#### derivatives at corners and jumps

cant define at these points

there is no rate of change

dx = undefined

corners can have mutliple tangents, one neg, one pos

so not allwoed

for any point there is a change forward or reserve 

these need to be equal 

if not equal, there is no derivative

a smooth corner is defined

is you zoon in enough (small) it will be flat

so there is a limit from above and below that has the same rate of change

#### constant

striahgt lines has constant deriviates

just a number

x(t) = 3t > x'(t) =3

the rate of change of X with respect to 1t is 3x

perfectly flat line = 0

# first & second takehome

first deriv is the stepness at t 

second deriv is the curviness at t

### indep and de

t is independant

pos is the dependant variable which varies in respect to the independant variables

### diff as a function

diff is an operator

a function between functions

it takes a function as input and output a function as output

fx -> diff -> df/dx

mapping between functions

Dx is the differential operator with respect to x

Dx(f) -> output is df/dx

they are not the same, df/dx comes out of Dx

### differentiation is a linear operator

k Dx(f) = Dx(kf)

mutliplying a function by k also scales the output by k

also

Dx(f1) + Dx(f2) = Dx(f1+f2)

if you have the derivatives of two functions, you can just add the derivs to get the deriv of the function if you were to add them together

adding two functions adds their slopes

### Summary

main point of this lecture is that we've built an algebra for the differential operator (Dx)

We can compose, add, multiply functions

We have:
- Linearity rules
- Chain rule
- Product rule

Differentiion operator tells us how (fast) things change
