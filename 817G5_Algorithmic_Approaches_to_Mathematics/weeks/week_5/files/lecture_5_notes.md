# Lecture 5 Notes: Prob and Stats

An experiment is a process with uncetain outcome

Probability theory is a mathmatical framework to deal with caracterising quantifying uncertain evetns

#### Seating Example & Terminaology

Eating seating outcome combination is an outcome

Combination of outcomes are events

Events is a set of outcomes

Events gave a set algebra


- Union (or) U
- Interaction (and) N
- Complement (not/without)

every event has a probability

P: events  -> [0,1]

0 <= P(x) <= 1

Probability is wy of expressing partial knowledge of an event

There is no correct probability 

Prob is subjective

Maybe based on info availble and opinion

A probability spaice is:

1. Sample space. Set of all possible outcomes

2. Event space. Set of all possibl events (combinations of events)

3. Probablity function, Assign prob to single event


Sample: Every possible seating
Event: All combinatons where the backrow is filled

Events will uncompase outcomes but usually not all of them. Just subsets

Events can have intersections and unions

Mutually exclusive events. There is no intersection (N)

P[E1 U E2] = P[E1] + P[E2] - P[E1 N E2]

- prob of event1 
- prob of event2
- removing the prob when they occur together (union)

if mutually exclusive the P(E1 N E2] = 0

P[E2|E1] = conditional prob

Independant events are not mutally exclusive 

they are events that done impact the outcome of something else

i.e. eating eggs for breakfast and whether it will rain tomorrow

C = subset

i.e. in E1 means you are in E2

E^complement 

# Random Variables

These are functions (not variables)

they are quant questions about an experiement

a function that maps from outcomes to numbers

Random value takes an event set

An RV example:

What was the number of unfulled seats? X(w)

X() function
w = input

In input of a randon variable is the outcome of an experiment

An outcome is in the subspace of the OUTCOME SPACE
