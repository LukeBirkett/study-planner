# Lecture 7 - Optimisation (Main)

minimas and maximas have a zero deriviaive final point

## mutli optimisation variables

think about 2 variables but applies to n variables

f(x) x1^2 + 3x2^2 
x = [x1, x2]

can plot 3d plots as 2d contour plots

3rd dim is encoded in the colour

think altitude plots



## Parital Derivatives

[VERY IMPORTANT GO BACK AND TAKE NOTES OF ALL THIS SECTION]

vector partial deriviatives to get the optimisated points

vector of functions

known as directional deriviative

vector dot producted with the partial deriviatives

note, partial deriviatives are the gradient (of their direction/varibale)

gradient uses the upside down triangle as its symbol

partial dervatives keep other variables as constant numbers

i.e. pd of x1, just do the x1 entries and keep the otheres the same 

but the entries have to depend o nthe x1 

other wise they are ignored

i.e. 4x1*1x2, keep the x2 the same


i.e. 1x2*2x3, both disspear
