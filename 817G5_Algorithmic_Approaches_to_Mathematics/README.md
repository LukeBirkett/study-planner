# Module Outline
You are a student. You cannot hope to eat all the mathematics in this world. One purpose of this module is to make you better at ingesting, digesting, and communicating what mathematics you encounter in your life. Another is to help you acquire taste: knowing when mathematical models and solutions to real world problems do (or do not) make sense, and what type of mathematics you'll need to ingest to solve a real-world problem.
