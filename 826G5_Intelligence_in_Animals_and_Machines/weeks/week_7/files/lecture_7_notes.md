# Lecture 7 - Tools - Notes

Use of tools is rare in animals and suggests some lineage to humans (who use tools)

Rareity is a function of difficultly and therefore intelligence

## Does tool use need a big brain?

Loose correleaiton between birds brain size and tool use

There is different ways to measure brain sieze, e.g. residual, executive 

## Is tool use actually useful?


## Tool Standard Definition (Beck, 1980)

Problems with becks definition:
‘tool use is the external employment of an
unattached environmental object to alter more
efficiently the form, position, or condition of another
object, another organism, or the user itself when the
user holds or carries the tool during or just prior to
use and is responsible for the proper and effective
orientation of the tool’

- big issue with the use of unattached. many tools are already attatched but in order to be utilised as tools need to be inderstood and manipliated in a particular. most would agree with this tool use

- this notion of spiders creating things but either letting or not letting go of the object (attached). permenantly connected would break definition

beck defintion is a top down definition

it starts with an idea of what we understand tool use to be and looked down to find things that fit the orginial example

## croc camo

Appears to use floating materials, twigs etc, to camo more

under beck definition, this would be tool use

but a bottom-up perspective would says that merely being in that area to hunt would result in this happening by chance

## beavers tool

using logs to stand on and get stuff higher up 

meet becks definition

but we already know that beavers are really good at using and maniulpating logs to create dams

why would doing something they already do, e.g. manipulate logs, be tool use

additionally, using a step is a very basic example of beavers natural behaviour

but it meets becks definition because it is external

## Hansell and Buxton 

look outside natural behaviour

## Simple Lab Experiements

Simple experiements can pick apart an animals understanding on physical relationships

fails, biases

if you demonstrate tool use, you may not understand the physics bhind how the tool use works

# What helps to establish tool use: Tool use in birds

## tool use in the lab

you can account for misalignments in bio mechanisms to identiify underlying ability to use tools

i.e. rook eyes can see directly down past beak so cant see down hole, hence dont use sticks for holes.  but if you make the enviroment clear using palstic where they can see laterally the tool then they can use tools

there is an underlying intellence to use tool but differents in embordmeent that allow tools

not cognition itself


# Robotic Tool Use

Tool use -> grapsing -> object manipulation
