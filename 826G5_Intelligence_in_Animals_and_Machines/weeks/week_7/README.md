# [Week 7 - Tool Used](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/34991/pages/week-7-tool-use?module_item_id=1509131)
In the lecture this week, we will look at the presumed link between tool-use and intelligence. As well as semantic and ecological considerations we can look at studies with birds that investigate whether birds have specific adaptations for tool-use and whether non-cognitive behavioural factors might be important. We will also look at the state of the art attempts to imbue robots with grasping and manipulation abilities which show us some convergence with animal behaviour. 

#### Learning outcomes
- Understand the reasons why tool-use might be rare in the animal kingdom.
- Understand the concept of folk-physics and how different animals might have different "folk-physics".
- Understand the importance of play for humans, animals and robot

# Seminar
In the seminar we'll be talking about cognitive maps in honeybees.
