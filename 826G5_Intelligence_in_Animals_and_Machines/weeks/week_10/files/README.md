# Lecture 10 - Brain Size

No like previous lectures as it isn't a behaviour or trait

## Most Animals Have Brians

Why?

Octs have most of nerv system outside of brain but they still have a brain

Worn, neurons spread acrross body but a concentration in the head (where a brian would be)

Still some benefit to something anaglous to brain 

rare to see animals without brains

ones that do have behaviour that isn't very aninmal like, more like plants

mobility is much less which we tend to see as animalistic

some animals don't have a trad brain but have a concetration of neurons much like a brain

derive signals and tell movement elsewhere, e.g. arms

## C. elegans. A perfect model for understanding wiring

putting combs together to say [something]

c = worm

if we understand bio in a simple animal we can move into a more complex anymore

4 nobel prizes related to research

do still not fully understand but know alot 

first animal where we knew full development understanding, child to adult

know every cell develop

know how all cells connect

has around 1000 cells, is very small worm

300 of the cells are a neurons (belong to n system)

huge ratio, much higher than us

7000 connections between cells

should be able to simulate worms behavioru using the structure we know about the worm 

have clusters of neurons near the front

could be soncidered too be like a brian

## is the c ns opt wired?

research done on a similiffed model but modern tech allows more

easy to udnerrstand + credit to orig author

Gangila neurons (not all)

small colleciton that are close together

seen to be distrceet

how different gangs connect

i.e. from leg to another decision centre

g's have variying connection

some parse some connect to many

org gang head to tail 

look at how gangs need to connect

e..g just to neighbours

e.g. to everything (systematic)

neigh = low wire use

system = high wire use

real data shows it it neither but looks more simialr to neigh

there connections are more closer to the line

[INSERT PICTURES]

Some geng need to connection into specific clusters hennce not a perfect neighbour

11 gangs have 11! possible order of connection

but if we know what need to connect to what, then we can reduce this

but of all 40m possible

the most efficent into terms o minimal tissue ends up reflecting the true bio model

minimal cost seems to be related to bio

this org involves a cluster of gang close to end of the animal - a brain

a "brain" minimise wires

## Where should you put the brain?

brain have 100 times more intputs then outputs (human) [REF]

Output is tiny amount per second 

huge amount more info is need to ccreate output and it is the output that dicated beahviour [INSERT CORRECT NUMBER HERE]

Something about components being as close as possible to cluster/brain

brain = reduce wire

moving towards sensors = reduce wire

e.g. brain in the head/face. eye, ears, nose

## brain body allometry

body size is biggest predictor of brain size

bigger brain needed for repetetive functions. bigger body = more proceess

the is a prediction line based on body vs brain

humans are furtherest away from line

disprop brain size

dogs are smallest brain vs body prop

domest takes away lots of brain challenges

brain can reduce in size. more energy for other funcs

## Social Brain


neo cortex scales with group size in primates

size of social groups

how many poeple can you stay upto date with meaningful info

## socail brain hypo - pairbond

outside primates, resid brain size is predicted by pairbonding

pairbonding requires lots of additonal info

knowledge of other life as well as your

communication, planning, co-ordination

## social brain hypo for insects

mushroom like brains larger in social bees (insects)

larger brains influences by social

but Dujardin (1850) was wrong

is isn't due to social 

but instead brain size scales with forgaging stsyle

insects that go off and hunt have larger brains

lots of navigation, need to rember stuff and context about stuff

oppose to staying put and eating the surroundsings

## innovation and behavioural flexibility

weak relation between innovation rate and residual brian size

antoher relationship, doesn't contradistic other theories

## things that correlate with brain size


## correlations

correls are just measuring something and comparing to brain size

could have arise due to a mutual relationship to something else

or something underpinning these

## weak correlation of cognition of braain size across specices

suggests brain size isnt best measure

should be measuring neurons

getting better relationship with cog traits than you go with brain size

Barron and Mourmourakis (2023)

## What happens when we select for brain size?

guppy brain experiement with large brains

tell us that brain size is heritable 

## does an increased brain have consquence

cog ability increase with size (in females only)

females need to patt rec more than males

bigger brains are better for specific purposes

brains got large but guts got smaller

so did the volume reproduc organise and offspring sizers were smaller

was measnured during experiement, only at the end

unintended cosceq of brain larger

## Ecpensive-tissue hypo

3 most expesive organs are in a trade-off 

theory is that brain size can only increase when there is some offset to having a smaller gut and less reprod

i.e. if you can find better food, it does doesn't matter than gut is less. spare engery to use for brain

two routes to increasing brain size

1. increase net engery input (food, store, social)
2. change in engery allocation (repod, loc)

## summary part 2




## What happens with more neurons in the sensory motor system?

bigger brain = more of the same or bigger resolition

more components into same thing

## moduliatiy in large brains

wire length

is you have clusters in the brain that do certain things

need to find a way to aggregate info from differ areas

can modularise and put signal modalities togoether

the modularity reduces the wire

that also means wire reduction encourages modularity

this is oppose to a distributed set up

global connections in a brains/networks become very large as the netweork growths

it growth expo

much near to have modulars that are locally connected with singal connections joining them together

occasionally long range connections between the modules

this minimizes wire

## modularity and the mosaic model of brain evolution

mods allows brain regions to specalised indep

evolution can selelect for the expansion of indiviudal modules without the cost of expanding the entire brain

mech for evolution to tune very specific areas and behaviour 

# Andys Part of Lecture

# What happens if we add mor eneurons in Artifical Neural Networks?

## ANNs as models of brains

early idea of brain as elec circ in 30s/40s

bio neuron > ANN ctructure

inputs, weights and neurons, output as sum of weights and inputs

## train ANNs, learn by example

suprivsed learning

algo is iterative and slow, not biological 

i.e. where is the teacher in the brain that knows the correct output

but it shows up how we can learn from examples

this allows us to make more biological inspired models 

it is a starting point

## NetTalk

mid 1980s

learn to pronounce speech from text

Sejnowski & Rosenberg (1987)

## increasing size of ANNs: deep neural nets

theory of nns was largely unchanged for decades

changed due to:
- comp power
- loads of data
- trickes (layers, convo, relu, auto-encoders)

breakthrtoughs came ffrom vision

convols are bio-inspired to an extent

## how do we/AI tell cats from trucks?



[got bored of taking notes of this section, it was a general intro into the basics of neural networks. NN, CNNs, Kernels, layers, fwature maps, low level features, high dim features, mnist, freezing layers, train later layers etc)]

[moving into adaptive system inspired stuff, brooks, temporal]
