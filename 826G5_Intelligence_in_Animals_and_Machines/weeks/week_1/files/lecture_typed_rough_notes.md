## What is Intelligence?

Defining intelligence:
 - Intelligence as adpative behaviour
 - Survinal and evoluational fitness

An agent is a ghing that operates in the world

Human intelligence is standardised through tests and qualififations but how to measure animal intelligence in isolation and has a benchmark with humans

Human intellgience is often associated with speed of information processing 

Animals should be able to do this type of test and hencefourth we should have a route to comparisons with humans 

However, when we conduct tests explicity in this way, we find things like Pigeons being rated more intelligent than humans and this breaks my hypothesis. Does this mean the test is wrong? Or our hypothesis is wrong?

When we use speed as a measure, the inverse of our expectations generally occurs

Another approach to defining intelligence is to take an anthropcentric approach whereby we outline and checklist several traits

An issue here is that we traverse the common road block of language. Humans have evolved to speak where no other animal has so how can we compare?

This is seen as a **top-down** approach to intelligence where we start with human intellignece traits and look elsewhere for commonalities which we generally fail to find (language)

This module focuses on a **bottom-up** approach. This is where we observe basic, rudimentary beahvours which peice together to create complex outputs 

[Clever animals and killjoy explanations in comparative psychology (Shettleworth, 2010)](https://github.com/LukeBirkett/study-planner/blob/main/826G5_Intelligence_in_Animals_and_Machines/weeks/week_1/readings/shettleworth_2010_killjoy_explanations.pdf)

Note, the terms "bottom-up" and "top-down" are used many times through various branches of liturature with varying definitions. The defintition we are working from are governed by the above article

We want to understand how the things we interpret as intelligent formed 

An anthropic (human) approach to defining is bad because it doesn't dig into the semantics of why something occurs or exists

Evolution does care about the semantics

Adpative behaviour leads to an increase of fitness and survival

Intelligence is what organisms do

One issue to think about is whether there is exists an intelligent vs unintelligence way to produce an output. This concept is explores in the article [Slime Mold Cognition (Reid, 2023)](https://readinglists.sussex.ac.uk/leganto/nui/citation/24520950510002461?institute=44SUS_INST&auth=SAML)

## Where Does Behaviour Come From?

There are 3 components that work together to form behaviour: Environment, Body and Controller (brain)

Thinking about a car/vehcicle, speed emerges through interaction with the enviroment, movement doesn't merly exist in isolation

Behaviour is something that emerges

[Vehicles, experiments in synthetic psychology (Braitenberg, 1984)](https://readinglists.sussex.ac.uk/leganto/nui/citation/23770971060002461?institute=44SUS_INST&auth=SAML&continue=)

A thought experiement, think about behaviour of agents with simple mechanisms, the compexity of an envirorment and how the agent interacts

A complicated eviroment with often leads to a seemingly more complex interaction between the two but there is no additional complexity/intelligence added to the agent to navigate the enviroment compared to life in a simple env. Has the agent become more intelligent?

DEFINITION: **Situatedness** = this is how agents interact with their enviroment

DEFINITION: **Embodiement** = Simple brain + body = ability to produce behaviour 

Grey Walter was a researcher who created the tortoises which are basic robots that respond to their enviroment

He was an early cybernetition

Behaviour is dicated by the parameters of a body

Situatedness can be interpreted as the impact of an environemnt on an agents behviour

Complex enviroment can leads to complex behaviour 

Recall the trifecta of body, environment and brain

Part of a solution is embodiment 

The brain (controller) outsources compute to the body which is adpated/suited to a completing a task

As an example, spiders and scorpions legs stand in a circle, this means that even without good sight they can intentifed movement through vibrations and more accordingly. The standing circle and the placement of the legs act as directionary sensors

Embodiement is a hugely important aspect of robotics 

It's important not to tell the body over shadow the importance of the brain. It is easy to get lost in the impact of the environment and body

## Learning Objectives
- Defining intelligence is hard
- Especially for the purpose of human vs animal comparisons
- A human-centric, anthropcentric definition creates the widest gap
- Biology definitions are more inclusive
- We want to understand where behaviour comes from: brain, env, body
