# What is a model? 

There are different types of models

A statistical model represents relationships between variables

A physical model is a construction of a thing, i.e. robotics, appearances, movements

A conceptual model details a respresentation in abstract form. Core concepts of a system and relationships. Graphs/Drawn/Visuals

A computational model is the focus of this model: 

- Respresent behaviour as a system of mathematics
- Identify functions that reproduce behaviours
- Simulation some real life behaviour
- Have parameters, i.e. learning rate, which we can change and explore to impact behaviour

All models simplify a real-life action which is complex. Simplifications are obtained through assumptions and logic explicits. 

Models must be predicated on hypothesis which can be tested. Real vs simulated

# Kiljoy Paper Notes

- Opinion piece
- Discessed the cognitive capabilities of animals
- Deals with the issue of anthropic/human-centric definitions of intelligence
- It is fine to suggest human intelligent traits could be present in animals
- But to correct do this, it needs to be pit againsts well defined alternative answers
- These answers should be simpler, lower-level reasonings
- Humans have developed specfic features such as the mechanical ability to vocalise and speak. The inablility for animals to speak does not explicity mean that animals do not posses the underlying intelligence to do so. 
- A killjoy is the most simple, rudimentary explanation. It is a killyjoy because it is less interesting and least likely to form the basis of new worthy catch lines
- The killjoy approach also applies to human intelligence in isolation. Often the things we output that appear complex are the combintation of several low-level peices of intelligence working together
