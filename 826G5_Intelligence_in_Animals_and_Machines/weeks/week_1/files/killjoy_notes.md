#### Lloyd Morgan's Canon
By C. Lloyd Morgan, forbidding unsupported anthropomorism if there exists a explanation of a lower standing

"In the contemporary study of animal cognigtioj, demonstrations that complex human-like behaviour arises from simple mechanisms rather than from 'higher' processes"

"Such insight or theory of mind, are foten seen as uninteresting and 'killjoy"

The justification for valuing anthro explanations of animal behaviour can be traced to darwin

Darwin and supports often used anecodotes to show that animals could think and solve problems

These supported claims lead to lloyd morgans cannon and development of experiemental approaches (thorndide)

Theory of mind is the understanding that other individuals have minds: belieds, desrires, intentions etc

The label killjoy originated in Dennetts analysis of level of intentionality in cognitive ethology
