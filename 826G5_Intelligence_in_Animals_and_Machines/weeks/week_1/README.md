# What is intelligence and does it need a brain?
In the first topic we will focus on definitions of intelligence, why many definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and why we may not need to care. We then introduce a loose definition of intelligence as adaptive behaviour that is, behaviour that is useful in terms of survival and evolutionary fitness. This allows us to focus on interesting behaviour in animals, rather than definitions, and to discuss how such behaviour can come from animals with very small or even no brains as a result of the interaction of their body acting within and environment. 

## Learning outcomes
- By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Define intelligence in a way that is inclusive of animals.
- Explain the problems of defining intelligence in a way that ends up with semantic arguments.
- Explain where behaviour comes from and show how it ‘emerges’ from the interaction of brain, body and environment.
