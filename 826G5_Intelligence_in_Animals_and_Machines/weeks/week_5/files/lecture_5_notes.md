# Lecture 5 Notes - Navigation

Walking in a straight line

Humans are bad at walking in a straight line without cues from the skinny (sunny not cloudy)


#### Insect Navigation


#### Path Integration

encode coodinates relevative to a start point, i.e. nest 

#### Sun as Direction Information

Sun compass

Sun as reference
 - Bees waggle dancing use the sun a refernce point to point towards their location

Inante knowledge of sun movement

#### Embodient as Measure of Distance

PI needs instance information

Ant use their stride and steps as a measure of distance estimation

## Navigation by Image Matching

ant eye is low-reso but wide-field

ants navigate with info from crude paromas

relyling a lot on the height of objects in the their horizon

sky vs not sky

why is low reso information sufficent? 
 - image different change smoothly
 - resolution doesn't change that
 - follow the gradient from a starting point


#### Ant Actions Neural Network

Small network to reproduce ant routes

matching images to dictate acitons, i.e. routing

####Â Summary

insects are not mapping

they are using an action based approach 

it works as it backup by evolued behaviours
 - Path Integration
 - Visually Scanning
 - Systematic search


## What are the Limits of Instect Navigation?


## Robotic SLAM

Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping

Sense position of features in the world

move, sense, update estimates based on how much features should have moved
