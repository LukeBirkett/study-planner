# [Week 5 - Navigation](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/34991/pages/week-5-navigation?module_item_id=1509129)
In the navigation lecture, we will look at the strategies that are common to different animals and how those strategies might be combined. The core strategies are Path Integration (PI) and view based guidance. We will then consider what behaviours would be the hallmark of an internalised Cognitive Map, we will see limitations in the navigational abilities of insects and by looking at the neural substrate of navigational abilities in mammals, we can see where in the brain complex spatial abilities might reside.

#### Learning outcomes
- Understand the basic navigation toolkit that is phylogenetically widespread and shared by most animals. 
- Think about how some animals might combine navigational information to make more complex spatial representations.
- Describe different robot navigation algorithms that do or don't rely on building maps.

# Seminar
n the first half of the seminar I'll explain Assessment 1 and we'll go over any questions you have

Then, we will be discussing a simple computational model describing how house hunting ants select new nest sites. The modelling paper will form the basis of your modelling report assignment (should you choose to do that), so do make sure you read it before the seminar so you get the most out of the session. We will also be working with the model in the next lab class
