# Introduction

In the following sections are the pre-existing content related to lab 3 & 4 which is a precursor to the assessments. The primary focus is the paper by Robinson et al. (2014). This paper was orginally focused on in the Week 5 Seminar before being fed into Labs 3 & 4 in which a coded system of papers model is explored. A full exploration of the papers, resources, labs and code will be documented in the file `lab_notes.md`. The content of this file will make up the prelimiary knowledge and understand to build out the final assessment. This assessment does not have to be on Robinson's model, although it can be, but this lab work will likely help establish the building blocks for the paper - likely in conjection with another topic studied on the module. Once this lab work is completely scoped out and understood, a new `.md` file will be created as working file to start the planning and iterating on the assessment itself. 

# Lab

### [Lab Working File](lab_notes.md)

This is the entire working file for the labs and papers. It contains: 
- File locations and links for all of the relevant and used material. 
- A breakdown and notes of the Robinson papers explored, particularly the main Robinson et al. (2011) paper
- Disemination of the lab briefs and content taken from canvas and put into my own words with any additional information and thoughts that were required to understand the direciton of the labs. 
- It has the results and analysis from the both of the labs including any extra work undertaken. It will also include written explanations of the code and direction on where certain functionalities are found in the code, e.g. what line. 

### [Week 5 Seminar Robinson](IAM_week5_seminar.pdf)
This is the 'lecture' slides followed for the original seminar session on the main Robinson paper: "A Simple Threshold Rule". For this session we read the paper before hand, listened to a lecture given by Maxine which followed these slides and broke out in a small group discussions.

### [Canvas Lab 3: Lab Page](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/34991/pages/lab-3-monte-carlo-simulation-of-collective-behaviour)

This is the first lab session working with the Robinson model. The goal is of this session was to introduce us to working with scilla setup of a real biological system. We were working with a Monte Carlo style model whereby simulation sample from given distributions. The lab was a chance to play with and test the various parameters and to try to understand how and why the system behaves as it does. We had the ability to look at individual ants behaviour to understand how the aggregate/collective outcomes occur. The link to this page is to the canvas page itself but the brief and information has been diseminated out into `lab_notes.md` under the Lab 3 section. 

### [Lab 3 Code Slides](IAM_lab_3.pdf)

This is some sort of lab accompaniment. It goes through bits of the code in more detail. I haven't gone through this properly yet. 

### [Canvas Lab 4: Guided Notes](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/34991/pages/lab-4-guided-tasks)

TODO: Work through and explain `Lab 4`

### [Lab Code](weeks/labs/IAM_Sussex_labs/lab_3_robinson)

This is the location of the code repository used for labs 3 and 4.
