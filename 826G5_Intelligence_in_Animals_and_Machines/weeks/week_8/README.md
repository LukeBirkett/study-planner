# [Week 8 - Social Intelligence](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/34991/pages/week-8-social-intelligence?module_item_id=1509133)
We will look at bottom-up accounts of Social Intelligence, thinking about phylogenetically widespread building blocks that might underpin it. Furthermore, we can look at what social intelligence allows, namely culture. Culture is a good example where it would be possible to take a top-down perspective and go looking for examples in the animal kingdom. Because there are not many we would be widening the gap between humans and non-human animals without gaining an understanding of how culture might come about. A bottom-up account of types of social learning and how they might underpin aspects of social intelligence, and even culture, is more satisfying.

The aim of discussing social robotics was to highlight the difficulty of building a robot that has genuine social understanding. In fact this is almost impossible at the moment. However, robots can be built that provide appropriate social cues such that humans will interact with them naturally, which can be very useful in a medical or educational context.

#### Learning outcomes
- Think about the social intelligence of humans in a bottom-up way.
- Understand that the "intelligence" of social robots is often "faked"
- From the seminar you will gain experience in evaluating primary research in terms of the themes of the module.
