# Lecture 8 -  Social Intelligence

## Reqs for a Social Brain (FF, 2010)

bottom up account of social intelligence

a selection of bottom up questions about how to identify social intelligence

"is it an agent"
- in this sense, is something that has agency

how to decide if something is an agent?

something you can interact with

lots of ways to do this within species, i.e. indentify of specicices

chemical recognition

ants use this and are easily tricked

elephants often use local recognition


things become more tricky when you want to identify any specicies or agent, not just the same as you

visual animals share a class of biological movement perception

identify biological movement/motion

baby chicks have a tendnacy to follow biological movement 

exp test bio vs synthetic movement, prefered biological stimulus

## What is it doing?

Humans attribute intention to non-static objectins movements

lens of intention and agency

create idea of narrative

intrept how agents are interacting and what they are doing 

humans do this really well 

appears that some animals do as well

crows epect agents to be responsible for the movement of objects

## perspective taking

understanding that agents are agents and thus can  behave like you

automatic imitation allows for social sharing of information 

think about looking upto the sky when you see other people doing it

some agents can understand that a agent has their own perspective, different from ours

taking a perspecive

true perspective taking shows an underdtanding of 'other'

automatically aquiring information from the perspective of other agents

## 4. Imitation/Understanding

## 5. Theory of Mind

belif about the mind of others on which you can act on 


# What Social Living Allows

rentention of expertise

accumulation of information

## Intro of Culture in the Wild

teach groups in a population to do something different

birds will swtich their method to that of their wider group

the deisre to confirm to social norm

chimps create their own portfolio of methods and behaviours

could be culture, could be genetics, could be env based

hallmark of uluture wpuld be continung methods or behaviours accross into new tasks
