some tasks are easy due to specific predisositions and associative learning (simple learning)

gives way to complex and impressive behvaiour 

# Unexpected Cleverness

Learning Outcomes (need to fill in)

Cleverness becomes easier to define and underdtand once we understand embrodiment and situatedness

## Aninal minds after dawrin
difference between animals and man is one of degree not kind"

promote continutty between animals and humans

this led to an increase in anthro definitions of intelligence 

verifying intelligence often because anecdotal

Romanes gave anothro interpretations of ant behaviour 

# Morgans Cannon - C Lloyd Morgan 1903
Until you have reason to give a complex explanation you should give a simplier, lower-level one
-> insert quote

# Lessons Learings 
anothro descs don't help us understand how smart animal behaviour came about 

sceptical, rigorous, detailed oberserative or experiment needed

this leads to killjoy

# Killyjoy

Shettleworld (2010)

explain behaviours in terms is simple processes such as assoc learning and specifics predisps

e.g. clever hans, anthro = numeracy, killjoy = social cues and domesticated human cues (specific to species)

dog, instight of phys and prob solving > trial and error learning

simple (assoc) learning and specific predisp (embodiment and situedness)

killjoy isnt just about simple but instead forced you to think about how animal has ended up and developed as it has. same applies to humans

humans situatedness is very social

# Unexpected Cleverness in Small Brains

What is a small brain?

Neuron counts + relative to body size

# Small Spider

Have large pricipal eyes with a narrow field of view

Need to move their body to look around 

large eyes = high reso, small field of view

the bahviour is eye to anthro: visual, plan, strat

but killhoy = specie specifies and visal bahviour. perfect optimised for a world of braches and twigs

# What about machines 
flip killjoy logic into killjoy explans

we build 'species' with specific predispositions that fit a niche aka use case

ecological niche of robot vacuums
