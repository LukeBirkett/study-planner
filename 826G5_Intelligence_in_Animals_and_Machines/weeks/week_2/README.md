# Unexpected Cleverness
This week's lecture has two main strands. The first is a fun historical tour of how people have viewed animal intelligence in the past. From this you will see a repeating pattern of over and under estimation of the intelligence of animals. We will then look at some specific case studies of behaviour that would be seem 'intelligent' and can be described as inteligent when we use anthropomorphic terms - but we will take a "Killjoy" approach to understand how those behaviours might come about.

#### Learning outcomes
By the end of this unit of teaching and learning, you will be able to:
- Explain why Darwin and his acolytes wanted to explain behaviour in anthropomorphic terms.
- Describe Morganâ€™s Canon and how it laid the groundwork for killjoy explanations of behaviour?
- Explain how apparent smartness in invertebrates can be explained by their embodiment, situatedness and ecological niche.
