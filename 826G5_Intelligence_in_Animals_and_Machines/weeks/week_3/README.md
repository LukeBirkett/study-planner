# [Week 3 - Collective Intelligence](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/34991/pages/week-3-collective-intelligence?module_item_id=1509127)
In Lecture 3, we will look at Collective Intelligence, looking at specific case-studies of social insect systems and the principles by which collective decision making can be implemented. We don't talk about social insects by chance. Because individual foragers from a single social insect colony are all working towards the same goal, evolution has been able to select for optimal co-operation. Unfortunately most animals are selfish and competitive, even when in social groups. So it is no surprise that we don't see optimal decision making in human groups, even though there is sometimes the statistical evidence to suggest that it would be possible. We will also look at some examples of swarm robotics. One of the important things here is to evaluate the properties of biological swarm systems and why they are desirable to engineers, although we can see that we are a long way from real world applications.

#### Learning outcomes 
- Define and give examples of systems that are stigmergic and/or self-organising
- Understand my collective intelligence sometimes fails, especially in human groups.
- Evaluate the properties of biological swarm systems and why they are desirable to engineers

# Seminar 
This week we're going to cover 2 papers, so please read both. They're a really nice pair, and are related to your your Week 2 Unexpected Cleverness lecture. The first one describes a study purporting to show that bees can do arithmetic and can therefore represent numbers.The second paper argues that numerical cognition is not needed for the bees to perform that task, and supported that argument by building a neural network model that does not have numerical cognition yet can still "do the sums"
- [x] Numerical cognition in honeybees enables addition and subtraction [(Howard et al, 2019)](https://github.com/LukeBirkett/study-planner/blob/main/826G5_Intelligence_in_Animals_and_Machines/weeks/week_3/files/numerical_cognition_honeybess.pdf)
- [x] Non-numerical strategies used by bees to solve numerical cognition tasks [(Maboudi et al 2021)](https://github.com/LukeBirkett/study-planner/blob/main/826G5_Intelligence_in_Animals_and_Machines/weeks/week_3/files/non_numerical_strategies.pdf)
