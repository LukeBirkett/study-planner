# Seminar Notes

## magnitude estimation

disern size, density etc 

aka how much

mid-level rocces related to preception

## numberical cognition

sense of number 

arithmatic 

symbolic and abstract

symbol representation instead of phyical things

higher-level ability

studying/isolating numerosity is hard

the number symbols are not inherent, they need to be taught

generally for animals literal shapes are used instead of symbols

is here is that there is mutli-modal cross over

for example, count of peices can be estimated by assesing the area covered

area is a continuous measure instead is a discrete

counting is discrete so this is an issue

cannot possibly normalise for all co-correlated continous cues
