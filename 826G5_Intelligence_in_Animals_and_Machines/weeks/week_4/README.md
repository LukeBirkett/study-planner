# [Week 4 - Moving through the world](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/34991/pages/week-4-moving-through-the-world?module_item_id=1509128)
Lecture 4 is about the mechanisms by which agents control "movements through the world", but the real message is about the sensory systems of an agent being at the service of behaviour. We start with a Psychologist called Gibson who wanted to think about how natural behaviours depend on easily acquired information. By focusing on the information that can be "Directly" available for the control of behaviour, one thinks about the ecologically relevant information that evolution would pick up on, rather than evolution building general purpose perceptual systems where the job is to build an internal model of the world so that behaviour can be planned internally, that would be known as Indirect Perception. 

#### Learning outcomes 
- Describe how both the fly and the human can be thought of in a Gibsonian way. 
- Discuss the successes and failures of biorobotics projects inspired by insect sensori-motor circuits.
