# Lab 2 - Elementary Motion Detection

This labs purpose is to simulate animal behaviour and analyse the output of simulations to answer research questions. The lab starts with a working, coded system and through analysis we to understand how it works and what makes it fail. This system we are using is very complex with many paramaters, too many to explore all of them

## What are we modelling?

**Bees centering response.** When flying through a narrow space bees will naturally go in the center. But bees do not have sterospoic vision. This means that they **do not have depth perception** like we do. The suggestion is that they instead use **optic flow independently in each eye.**
