# [Week 2: Document Classification](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/35030/pages/week-3-document-classification)
This week we will begin looking at the application of document classification.  We will consider different scenarios including the classification of:
- topic
- sentiment
- relevancy

In the context of a sentiment analysis task, we will consider different methods including word list based classification and, next week, a machine learning based approach using Naive Bayes classification.   We will consider how we evaluate classifiers i.e., how good are they?  Which is the best classifier for a given task / scenario / dataset?  We will introduce important evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F-score.  We will also discuss training and testing methodology and the importance of evaluating classifiers on held-out or unseen data.
