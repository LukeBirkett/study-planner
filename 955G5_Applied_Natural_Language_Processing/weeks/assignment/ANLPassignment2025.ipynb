    "In this code I am looping through each review in the training data whilst giving myself access to the wordlist and the label. \n",

    "On the all word lists I preprocess and normalise accounting for case, numbers, punctuation and stopwords. I am doing this to remove noise and get access to the words in their cleanest and more contextualised form and removing words devoid of meaningful context. I did not implement any stemming or lemmanisation as the goal is to obtain a word list, hence, readabliltiy is desired. \n",

    "Words that come out with a positive differential are candiates for the positive world list, and negative ones the negative word list.\n",

    "The cumulative word count is used to identify words that appear to be domain stop words. That is, words that appear to be disproporionately used in context of writing reviews. The frequency of these words in the domain of reviewing means they loose the context they might otherwise hold in general terms. I remove these words as candidates for the word list.\n",

    "Finally, the word list is sorting by the index [1] which is the word differential metric. Slices of the top and bottom 10 are taken which are the words that are most skewed towards being in positive or negative reviews, hence, should be highly representative of sentiment."
