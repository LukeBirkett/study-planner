# Week 2: Text Documents and Preprocessing
What exactly is text?  And what exactly is a word?   We will first define different units of text / meaning including characters, lemmas, words, sentences, paragraphs, documents and corpora.   How do we model one, such as a sentence, in terms of others, such as words?  Is it OK to treat a sentence or a document as a bag of words where order and, maybe also, frequency is ignored?  Or do we need a more complex sequence model?

From a practical perspective, we will examine the why and how of carrying out sentence segmentation and tokenization.  Then, we will look at other standard pre-processing or text normalisation techniques including case normalisation, stopword and punctuation removal, stemming / lemmatisation / morphological analysis and the use of regular expressions.  More generally, we will introduce the application of information retrieval and consider the advantages and disadvantages of different pre-processing techniques.
