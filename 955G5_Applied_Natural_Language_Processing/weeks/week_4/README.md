# [Week 4: Further Document Classification](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/35030/pages/week-4-further-document-classification)
This week, we will continue looking at the area of document classification.   This week, we will start by introducing some probability theory and then take a dive into machine learning, considering how a Naive Bayes classifier can be built.  One of the big challenges of applying machine learning techniques to natural language problems is data sparsity and we will see how a simple technique, add-one-smoothing, can be used to mitigate this in the context of a Naive Bayes classifier.
