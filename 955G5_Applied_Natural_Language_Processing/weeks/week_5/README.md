# [Week 5 - Document Similarity and Clustering](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/35030/pages/week-5-document-similarity-and-clustering)
We have spent the last couple of weeks thinking about document classification.  This week we will look at the related topic of document similarity or topic clustering.  Whereas document classification is generally considered to be a supervised task, with predefined classes and labels which we want to be able to apply to new data, topic clustering or document similarity techniques are often applied when we do not have predefined classes or topic labels.  We simply want to find which documents are most similar or which documents cluster together in some way.
