# [Week 1 Intro](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31028/pages/week-1-introduction-to-adaptive-systems-2?module_item_id=1492368)

In this lecture, I will introduce some core ideas, and then we will start to look at
1. Systems and their environments
2. Timescales and relative rates of change
3. Adaptation can be driven in many ways
4. “Adaptation” can mean either a process or a characteristic
5. Processes of adaptation take place over various timescales
6. All adaptation involves change, but not all change is adaptation
