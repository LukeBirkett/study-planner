[part 1 - intro to the module]

adaptive systems is extremely cross dis

[why study adaptive systems]
* fill in these bullet points from the slides
* two sides: scient + t

natural adaptive systems, superior to our own creations of intelligence

stdying natural systems can insire our own designs
* hexapod bodies systems, this is insect inspired
* artifical NNs
* CPG central pattern generators for locomotion

why study the artifical ones?
1. can experiment with them easily. simulations. automate. iterate. (cannot do with natural systems). store complete record of results with all variables.
2. may discover something that applies to natural systems (rare, usually the other way round)
3. can copy other peoples designs and incorporate into own work

**[module structure]**

10 lectures

5 labs, theorys applied in simulated systems

6 seminars, dicussions of adaptive systemss theory and report writing

*weekly structure* (fill in from slides)

**[assessments]**

1. 1000 word report, little bit of code, basic experiment, due week 8, worth 20% practice run
2. 3000 word report, a lot of coding required

both related to learning or some sort of evolution. maybe some sort of agent application

---
**idea:**

evolution, plants, environment, colours, art, agents, farming, events

1st step simulation a stable, adpative, natural environment hopefully in an visually artisitic form. grid form, each square is inited with a status. There exists some way the squares adapat and change, ideally based on its surroundings. 

2nd once this stable environment is established. learn the parameters of the system. what causes what? what allows what to settle? then experiement with agents acting on the environment. this should mimic permaculture practisice, i.e. using what the perceived rules are the land are to acheive an outcome, i.e. we want this portion of the square to be colour x, what triggers could be implemented so that the feedback loop results in a certain outcome. 

could also experiement this agents actually in tradional farming ways and explore how this impacts the enviroment overall. 
could also experiement with natural distasters, weather impacts, and just random changes to the end to encourage diversity and changes

**[part 2 - intro to adaptive systems]**

[LEARNING OUTCOMES, Slides + Recording]

**[systems and their environments]**

coupled systems, where agents and envs effect eachother. causual relationshops [import slide image]

system/agent coupled to its enviroment

the arrow in the image respresnets a kind of interaction

image is very high level and basic

arrows in both dirs = circular causality

sys influences env, which influences sys, vv

closed loops more interesting than open loops (why, rewatch this section)

**[the fitt-est]**

survival of the fittest

darwin, how well species were fitted to their env

evolutionionary fittness is a two way relationship between a population and its environment

speciies fitness is intristicly linked to the env it is in. if env changes fitness changes. what charactistics suit or perform (or lack there of) in given env

fitness does not mean physical fitness, speed, strength etc

progress in the natural world doesnt mean bigger, better, more complex

humans are an exception

progress genrally meeans more suited to env

the idea of progress applies more to actifical than to natural evolution

there are examples in nature that would be anti-progress in terms of bigger, better, more complex

stickles backs over time became less armoured from preds as their env didn't require it anymore (reverse evolution)

evoultion has a trade off. more armour requires more resources. resources are limited

fit means surviving and thriving. if something becomes more simple but still sruves then it is just as fit

fittness can easily go down when env changes

**[maintaining a good fit]**

sucessful sys fit well into their envs

often then sys adapt they do so in order to maintain a good fit to the env

bateson "the unit of survival is a flexible organism in its env"

also said that envs must also be flexible 

flexible can be exchanged for capable of adaptiing

coupled sys of agent and env can both change to fit changes in the other

**[timescales]**

[slides covered a bit on learning vs evolution]

the ability to learn

however, rate of evolution depends on rate of reproduction. bacteria very fast

**[time]**

time is. repeating compoenent of this module

today main interest is rate of change and relative rate of change

i.e. rate of change of eco system 

rate of change of evolution. takes generates so may not be quick enough to track env changes. this results in a loss of fitness and risk of non-survival

**[why do systems adapt]**

to learn, 
* a behaviour or action 
* how to solve a problem
* to compensate for injury or damage
* to adpat to changes in the environment
