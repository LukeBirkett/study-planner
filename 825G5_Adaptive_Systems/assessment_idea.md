1st step simulation a stable, adpative, natural environment hopefully in an visually artisitic form. grid form, each square is inited with a status. There exists some way the squares adapat and change, ideally based on its surroundings. 

2nd once this stable environment is established. learn the parameters of the system. what causes what? what allows what to settle? then experiement with agents acting on the environment. this should mimic permaculture practisice, i.e. using what the perceived rules are the land are to acheive an outcome, i.e. we want this portion of the square to be colour x, what triggers could be implemented so that the feedback loop results in a certain outcome. 

could also experiement this agents actually in tradional farming ways and explore how this impacts the enviroment overall. 
could also experiement with natural distasters, weather impacts, and just random changes to the end to encourage diversity and changes
