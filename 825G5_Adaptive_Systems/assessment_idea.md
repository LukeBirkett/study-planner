1st step simulation a stable, adpative, natural environment hopefully in an visually artisitic form. grid form, each square is inited with a status. There exists some way the squares adapat and change, ideally based on its surroundings. 

2nd once this stable environment is established. learn the parameters of the system. what causes what? what allows what to settle? then experiement with agents acting on the environment. this should mimic permaculture practisice, i.e. using what the perceived rules are the land are to acheive an outcome, i.e. we want this portion of the square to be colour x, what triggers could be implemented so that the feedback loop results in a certain outcome. 

could also experiement this agents actually in tradional farming ways and explore how this impacts the enviroment overall. 
could also experiement with natural distasters, weather impacts, and just random changes to the end to encourage diversity and changes

#### Adpated vs Self-Adative

An adpated system, is something which is adapted by some other system or external processes - such as an evolutionary algo - to have some desirable for beneficial characteristics.

> Possibly important for my idea. The environment will be a self-adpaptive system. But the farming system will be an adapted system will can be tweaked and optimized based on some metric.

# Env Average Neutral Status

I feel like there should be something in the envs setup whereby stabilitiy naturally leads to. Maybe using a scale set up where the land wants to average out to the centre. This would small in line with natures natural tendancy to lead to low entropic in general. Only a few pockets of lands will be truely unique and this due to a unqiue combination of circumstances that make them that way, i.e. a valley will be rich with fertile soil because it collects all the the minerals running off the valleys. 

Note sure where I was going with this but setting up the basic land so that it tends to settle into the same colour/scale is a sign that is has stability without control.
