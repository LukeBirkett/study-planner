## Introduction
This lab has 3 main aims:
- To set up the Python environment which will be used in this and future lab classes.
- To see negative feedback control in action, and to get some feel for both its power and its limitations.
- To introduce you to Pymunk, a relatively simple and easy to use physics engine for Python. Perhaps some of you will consider using it in assignments.
