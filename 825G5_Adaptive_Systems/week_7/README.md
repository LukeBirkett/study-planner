# [Week 7 - Introducing Ashby](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/31028/pages/week-7-introducing-ashby?module_item_id=1499770)
#### Learning Objectives
In earlier lectures we saw how some systems are self-stable, meaning that they are stable (in some way) without intervention. Technically, we can say that these systems have basins of attraction, like a ball rolling downhill into a valley, or a hot cup of coffee with its temperature "rolling" downhill to room temperature. We also saw that one of the effects of negative feedback control can be to make a system which is inherently unstable behave in a way that is stable. For example, an inverted pendulum (which is an analogy for a standing animal or robot) has an unstable equilibrium at the upright position, but when you add feedback control to this system (as well as the energy to move it) you can turn that unstable equilibrium into a stable one. We return to the subject of stability in this lecture, as it is central to Ashby's theory of adaptive behaviour [1]. Ashby's definition of adaptive behaviour is an unusual one - it is not quite the same as either the characteristic or process definitions that we have seen before. In today's lecture, we'll look at how he arrived at his definition. Next week we will look at how it leads to the theory of the ultrastable system.
